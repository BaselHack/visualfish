Visualizing chat for the Baselhack 2017

### Chat Visualiser
**Problem:**
Chat is utterly useless without a visualiser.

;)


**Proposed hack topic:**
An “online chat” web application that creates a realtime visual experience based on the contents of the chat. The app retrieves (hopefully) relevant images, videos, webpages, maps, emoticons, icons, or other content and displays them in a “visualiser panel” adjacent to the chat space.
(Maybe the core of the system could be used in other contexts than chat, such as live performance.)

**Data resources:**
Any Content API, such as...
